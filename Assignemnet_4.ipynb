It's a way of structuring programs using objects that interact with each other. Key concepts in OOP include classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism."

        " - Polymorphism in Python, in the context of inheritance, enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that is specific to their class. This is primarily achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a method is called on an object, Python checks the class of the object to find the appropriate method to execute. If the method is defined in the class, it is executed. If not, Python looks for the method in the parent class, and so on, up the inheritance hierarchy. If a subclass overrides a method, the subclass's version of the method is executed instead of the parent class's version. This allows objects of different classes to respond differently to the same method call, which is the essence of polymorphism."

        " - Method chaining in Python is a programming technique used in object-oriented programming where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement. It enhances code readability and conciseness by avoiding the need for intermediate variables. To implement method chaining, each method in the class must return the object itself (typically self) after performing its operation. This allows subsequent methods to be called directly on the returned object."
